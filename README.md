# Whats-on-this-Album

Have you ever wanted to copy the names of all the songs in an album in a nice formatted list, only to be thwarted by the tables on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_in_the_Arena_(album)#Track_listing) and [Genius](https://genius.com/albums/Gang-starr/Step-in-the-arena) (which are both amazing websites) where you need to copy extra data (such as the length of the song) only to format it yourself if you want the list to look nice in any way?

Probably not, but I have. This program will help to solve this problem by using a web scraper to copy the list of songs in an album and also format it for you. You can also input multiple albums and it will format a list of the songs in all of the albums on the list. Wow! Just amazing!

### Purpose
From this short and sarcastic README, I'm sure you can guess that I don't think anyone besides me will get any use out of this program. This repo is mostly to document things for myself and to practice using git, uploading packages, and writing documentation and good code.
